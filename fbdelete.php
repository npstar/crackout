	<ul><blockquote><h2>DELETE ENEMY'S FB ACCOUNT !!</h2></blockquote>

<P>Here is a method to delete any facebook profile or account.<br/>
It works 100%.<br/></p>

<p>But its just for educational purpose, So don't use it on anyone.<br/> 
Once Deleted ,<r> Profile can never be recovered.</r> Use wisely.<br/>
</P>

<p><b>WHAT ALL U NEED ?</b>
<br/></p>

<p>1. Victim's profile link ( you can get it easily ).<br/>

2. His/Her Email which he/she uses to sign in.<br/>

3. His/Her birth date which he/she has used in the profile.<br/>

4. Make an Email ID on gmail or yahoo with the first name and last name same as on victim's facebook profile.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>HOW TO DO IT
</b><br/><br/>
1. Go to this page:
 http://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=hack_nologin_access<br/>

2. Enter details.<br/>
 In the place of ' email address where you can be contacted ' , enter the fake email u created.<br/>

3. you will get a mail on that ID in which facebook people will ask your problem.<br/>
 Reply to them that you are XYZ( victim's name ) and you cant access your facebook account.<br/>
 Also you have lost access to your Email Address associated with the account.<br/>
 You dont know what to do now. <br/>
The hacker is coming online regularly and using your account.<br/>
 If the victim is a girl also write ' <b>I am a girl and it poses threat to my social life</b> ' and write anything you want that could make them take action.<br/>
 ( no need though in 100 % cases they delete the account )<br/>

4. After 2-3 days you will get a reply. <br/>
They will again ask you that you have access to your associated Email or not?<br/>
 Reply them that you still don't have access to it. And repeat what all you wrote in first mail.<br/>

5. Next Day or Same Day you will get an Email that your account is disabled.</p>



<p><r>ACCOUNT CAN NEVER AGAIN BE RECOVERED SO USE WISELY</r></p>

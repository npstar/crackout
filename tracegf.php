	<ul><blockquote><h2>TRACE YOUR BF's/GF's MOBILE NUMBER LIVE !!</h2></blockquote>

	<p>Trace & SPY Your GF Mobile Live For Free Instantly.<br/>
	
<r>Yes Guys, this is now possible !!</r><br/> 
	I m not joking.</p>
	<p> Many of us think that this is not possible or we have to spend some money for such services<br/>
 	but believe me that we don’t have to spend any money for getting this done.<br/></p>
	<p> Yes, <r>PhoneOnMap.com</r> makes it possible, which provides a free application that has to be installed in <r>GPS cell phone</r> and you are ready to track the phone from anywhere on the Internet.
<br/></p>
	<p>This application can beuseful for office work as well as family members.<br/>
	 You can track your child as well as your girlfrend/wife too(LOL) . This <r>PhoneOnMap.com</r> can be used world wide and you can use it while travelling too.</p>
	<p>The data is stored on the company’s server fora periodof one month.This can bean invaluable source for <b>sales and marketting department of an organization to track the marketing agents.
</b><br/>
	If you are worried about the security and privacy of the service, let me tell that it is very <b>secure</b> and your cell phone can not be monitored by any Unauthorized User as in order to access the tracking system,<br/>
	 you have to authenticate yourself through a personal code which was used as identification while installing applicationon cell phone.</p>

	<p><b>Features of GPS cell phone tracking system</b></p>
	<p>
1. GPS cell phone tracker and locater willnot work in the underground transportation.<br/>
	
2. The application does not work when the phone is turned off.
<br/>
        3. The data transmission outside provider’s coverage area will add roaming charges like any other phone service charges<br/>
	
4. Once application is uninstalled from cell phone then you can’t do anything .<br/>
	
5. On internet tracking system will showcell phone location between every <b>10 seconds to 10 minutes</b>,
	which depends on setting.<br/>
	
Accordng to me this kind of service is very important for parents to track their children and from a business usage point of view an invaluable part of companies involved in supply and delvery system like Courrier and Home delivery system.<br/>
	 This will help them to get a realtime location of the object and provide an accurate time frame for the delivery.
<br/>
	As of now this service does not provide the exact pin point location but the location determines in the range of 10-20 meters.<br/>
	 However with little intelligence the exact location can be easily determined especially when you wish to track your children or the cheating girlfrend…(lol)
